# Day XX — Notes from a tech video I watched

- Learned how browsers parse HTML, build the DOM, and combine it with CSSOM to create the render tree.  
- Found it interesting how the rendering pipeline works (layout → paint → composite) and how JS can block rendering if not handled smartly.  
- Idea to try later: experiment with `defer` and `async` scripts in a demo project to see how they affect page loading performance.
